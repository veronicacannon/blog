It's not uncommon to use `.to_s` in Ruby to cast a number to string.  
It's also a way to take an API response in a hash and log it safely.

String interpolation in Ruby also calls `.to_s` -- automatically.

```ruby
person = {:name => 'Juanita', 
          :salary => 200000, 
          :title => 'Senior Software Engineer'}
person.to_s
# "{:name=>\"Juanita\", :salary=>200000, :title=>\"Senior Software Engineer\"}"
"#{person}"
# "{:name=>\"Juanita\", :salary=>200000, :title=>\"Senior Software Engineer\"}"
```
